Source for the Skreieweydo Logworks website. Built with SCSS, modular assets, and automated GitHub Actions deploy to server.
## Development

This repo contains the **source code** for the Skreieweydo Logworks website.  
Deployment is automated â€” only the processed `dist/` folder is published to **skreieweydo.github.io** via GitHub Actions.  
Commits to `main` are automatically built and published to:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://skreieweydo.github.io](https://skreieweydo.github.io)
The processed `/dist` is deployed automatically to [`skreieweydo.github.io`](https://skreieweydo.github.io) via GitHub Actions.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 18)
- npm (ships with Node)

## Stack
- **HTML5 + SCSS** â†’ modular, themed styles
- **Node + npm scripts** â†’ compile SCSS, build into `/dist`
- **GitHub Actions** â†’ CI/CD deploy into user site repo

---

### Scripts

- **Build the site:**
  ```bash
  npm run build

	â€¢	Preview locally:

npm run preview

Cleans any existing dist/ folder and copies source (index.html, css/) into a fresh dist/.

Serves the built site at http://localhost:5173.

	â€¢	Clean only:

npm run clean

Removes the dist/ folder (useful before rebuilds).

Deployment
	â€¢	Do not commit dist/ (itâ€™s in .gitignore).
	â€¢	On every push to main, GitHub Actions runs the build and deploys dist/ to skreieweydo.github.io.

Notes
	â€¢	Source lives here (index.html, css/, etc.).
	â€¢	Output (dist/) is disposable â€” regenerate anytime.
	â€¢	If you see a 404 on npm run preview, make sure youâ€™ve run npm run build first.
